TankControl

Attach TankControl.cs as component to player model. This will enable tank controls which are used in the older Resident Evil games.

Pressing W or UP will always make the character walk forward.

Pressing S or DOWN will always make the character walk backwards.

And A/D/LEFT/RIGHT will make the character rotate left or right.
